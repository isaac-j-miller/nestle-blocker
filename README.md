# nestle-blocker
hides nestle products from grocery store websites by intercepting XHR requests and removing products sold under Nestle-affiliated brands
## tested websites:
- Giant
- Safeway

## todo/problems:
- Amazon uses SSR, apparently, so we cannot intercept requests in the same way as with the other stores
